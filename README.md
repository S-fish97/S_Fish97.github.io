# Xiao-Yu Personal Brand — GitHub Pages Starter (with Shopee Post)

A minimal GitHub Pages site using **Minimal Mistakes**, pre-filled for Xiao-Yu (小瑜),
now including a Shopee coupon-style page that mimics the structure you wanted (TOC, sections, copy buttons).

Quick Start:
1) Create a repo named `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io` on GitHub.
2) Upload all files from this folder.
3) Settings → Pages → Source = `main` (root).
4) Visit `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io`.
